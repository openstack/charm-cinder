  openstack-origin:
    type: string
    default: distro
    description: |
      Repository from which to install. May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Ubuntu Cloud Archive e.g.
      .

      cloud archives are available and supported.
      .
      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  harden:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.
  enabled-services:
    type: string
    default: all
    description: |
      If splitting cinder services between units, define which services
      to install and configure.
  block-device:
    type: string
    default: sdb
    description: |
      The block devices on which to create LVM volume group.
      .
      May be set to None for deployments that will not need local
      storage (eg, Ceph/RBD-backed volumes).
      .
      This can also be a space-delimited list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder LVM volume group - each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.
      .
      May be set to the path and size of a local file
      (/path/to/file.img|$sizeG), which will be created and used as a
      loopback device (for testing only). $sizeG defaults to 5G
  volume-group:
    type: string
    default: cinder-volumes
    description: Name of volume group to create and store Cinder volumes.
  overwrite:
    type: string
    default: "false"
    description: |
      If true, charm will attempt to overwrite block devices containing
      previous filesystems or LVM, assuming it is not in use.
  remove-missing:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, if logical volumes are not allocated on them.
  remove-missing-force:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, even when logical volumes are allocated on them. This
      option overrides 'remove-missing' when set.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephemeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Providing this option will force an unmount of the ephemeral device
      so that it can be used as a Cinder storage device. This is useful for
      testing purposes (cloud deployment is not a typical use case).
  database-user:
    type: string

    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Comma-separated list of key=value config flags. These values will be
      placed in the cinder.conf [DEFAULT] section.

    default: 8776
    description: OpenStack Volume API listening port.
  use-internal-endpoints:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Openstack mostly defaults to using public endpoints for internal
      communication between services. If set to True this option will
      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      Cinder. By default, the number of workers for each daemon is set to
      twice the number of CPU cores a service unit has. When deployed in
      a LXD container, this default value will be capped to 4 workers
      unless this configuration option is set.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will
      be prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like 'juju-myservice-0'. If
      you are running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups. If left empty, the
      nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup

    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although the configuration of a pool can be always be changed
      within ceph itself or via the charm used to deploy ceph).
  restrict-ceph-pools:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Cinder can optionally restrict the key it asks Ceph for to only be able
