  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      When deploying to Precise, the default distro option will use
      the cloud:precise-folsom/updates repository instead, since Cinder
      was not available in the Ubuntu archive for Precise and is only
      available via the Ubuntu Cloud Archive.
  enabled-services:
    default: all
    type: string
    description: |

      to install and configure.
  block-device:
    default: sdb
    type: string

      The block devices on which to create LVM volume group.

      May also be set to None for deployments that will not need local
      storage (eg, Ceph/RBD-backed volumes).

      This can also be a space delimited list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder LVM volume group - each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.

    default: 2
    type: int
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores withing the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
      your ceph cluster).
  volume-group:
    default: cinder-volumes
    type: string
    description: Name of volume group to create and store Cinder volumes.
  overwrite:
    default: "false"
    type: string

  glance-api-version:
    default: 1
    type: int
    description: |
      Newer storage drivers may require the v2 Glance API to perform certain
      actions e.g. the RBD driver requires requires this to support COW
      cloning of images. This option will default to v1 for backwards
      compatibility older glance services.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      By default, all services will log into their corresponding log files.

  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      SSL certificate to install and use for API ports.  Setting this value
      and ssl_key will enable reverse proxying, point Glance's entry in the
      Keystone catalog to use https, and override any certficiate and key
      issued by Keystone (if it is configured to do so).
  ssl_key:
    type: string

      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be

      your network interface.
