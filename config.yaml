      .
      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
  harden:
    type: string
    default:

      instead.
      .
      The block devices on which to create LVM volume group.
      .
      This can also be a space-delimited list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder LVM volume group - each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.
      .
      May be set to the path and size of a local file
      (/path/to/file.img|$sizeG), which will be created and used as a
      loopback device (for testing only). $sizeG defaults to 5G
  volume-group:

    default: "false"
    description: |
      The below LVM functionality is DEPRECATED. Use the cinder-lvm charm
      instead.

    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The below LVM functionality is DEPRECATED. Use the cinder-lvm charm

    description: |
      The below LVM functionality is DEPRECATED. Use the cinder-lvm charm
      instead.
      .
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, even when logical volumes are allocated on them. This
      option overrides 'remove-missing' when set.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The below LVM functionality is DEPRECATED. Use the cinder-lvm charm
      instead.
      .
      Cloud instances provide ephemeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Providing this option will force an unmount of the ephemeral device
      so that it can be used as a Cinder storage device. This is useful for
      testing purposes (cloud deployment is not a typical use case).

      cloning of images. This option will default to v1 for backwards
      compatibility with older glance services.
  config-flags:
    type: string

      configure services to use internal endpoints where possible.
  worker-multiplier:
    type: float
    default:
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      this service. By default, the number of workers for each daemon is

      value will be capped to 4 workers unless this configuration option
      is set.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm. A string that will
      be prepended to instance name to set the host name in nagios. So for
      instance the hostname would be something like 'juju-myservice-0'. If
      you are running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.

    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups. If left empty, the
      nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup

    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
      object it stores within the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
      applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
      rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
      effect (although the configuration of a pool can be always be changed
      within ceph itself or via the charm used to deploy ceph).
  restrict-ceph-pools:
